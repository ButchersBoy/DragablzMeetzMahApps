Dragablz Meetz MahApps
=

Demo applications to show [Dragablz](https://github.com/ButchersBoy/Dragablz) and [MahApps](https://github.com/MahApps/MahApps.Metro) being used together.

There are two runnable projects in the solution so try them both.  One shows a project based on the DragablzWindow, the other on the MahApps.MetroWindow.  Other than that the code is very similar, illustrating how MahApps and Dragablz can play together.

The code also illsutares a potential way you can use MVVM to populate your tabs.
